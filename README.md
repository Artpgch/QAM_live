This application visualizes the information flow, represented as a stream of decimal numbers, binary numbers, as well as a modulated radio signal. 
The graphical interface displays three corresponding graphs, as well as three indicators with the current decimal number, a binary number, and a complex number showing the current change in amplitude and phase shift of the radio signal.
